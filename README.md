Tic Tac Toe

This application, 
this should let the user play Tic Tac Toe in the console, I utilized technologies learned through the whole year as well as learning new teniques such as shorthand for loops as well as the integration of char. Being gone for a week really held back my progress, I initially wanted to create a tower defence game however, my progress was slow and so I decided to just create a snake game, all of these proved to be too difficult and I was left with 3 unfinished games, Tic Tac Toe being one of them. Although I would like to have one good functioning game, it wasnt very plausible because of my poor descisions

Application,
All one would need to do is to open the files in eclipse or any other java IDE and the code should run given that it works

How to use it,
With this application, you can play Tic Tac Toe to your heart's content with a robot

Credits,
I created this game myself with some logical help from many other people
